# SPARROW
SPARROW, Secure Private Advertising Remotely Run On Webserver, is an enhancement of TURTLEDOVE proposal aiming at providing more value for the ad ecosystem, more control and transparency, and safeguarding the user experience, whilst keeping all the privacy guarantees.

## Motivation

PARROW keeps TURTLEDOVE objectives, i.e: 

* People who like ads that remind them of sites they're interested in can choose to keep seeing those sorts of ads.
* People who don't like these types of ads can choose to avoid seeing them.
* People who wonder "how the ad knew" what they were interested in can get a clear, accurate answer.
* People who wish to sever their association with any interest group of which they are associated can do so, and can expect to stop seeing ads targeting the group.
* Advertisers cannot learn the browsing habits of specific people, even ones who have joined multiple interest groups.
* Web sites cannot learn the interest groups of the people who visit them.
While adding the following ones:

* Advertisers can retain campaign control and performance in so far as this does not infringe user privacy.
* All advertising use cases are covered by the proposition, not only re-marketing.
* Appropriate control on ad safety, brand safety and transparency in billing is provided to both advertisers and publishers.
* User experience while browsing the web is preserved.
